In addition to their importance to wildlife, both Lynde Creek Marsh and Cranberry Marsh provide many other important functions that are typical of the few remaining coastal wetlands found along this northern section of the Lake Ontario shoreline.

155164193,Southampton Boardwalk,Municipality of Saugeen Shores,www.saugeenshores.ca,Hiking or Walking,"112 years ago, a group of community-minded locals and tourists banned together to put on an amateur production of the famous Gilbert and Sullivan HMS Pinafore. They had a goal of raising money to put a boardwalk on the beach of Lake Huron stretching from the end of High Street to as far as the money raised could take them. Like many of us today, who walk along beach to watch and gaze at one of Southampton's beautiful sunsets, they wanted a boardwalk, so all could enjoy unhampered by the sand. Thus, with their fundraising dollars in hand, as the Pinafore, was a roaring success, they were able to build a boardwalk out of local wood from the foot of High Street extending to the Pier. In 1906, it is noted, in a then local periodical called the Summer Citizen, that it was replaced by cement and stretched from High Street all the way to the Long Dock at the end of present day Beach St. Now the boardwalk, aptly named the Pinafore after the original fundraiser, remains a part of Southampton. Its form may have changed with the times, but it has silently witnessed newlyweds hands locked together walking down the beach dreaming of their futures; watched as kids run for the swing sets on the beach while their parents sit down exhausted on one of the now strategically placed benches; and the once young, elderly residents with fond memories of an easier time, walk with their young grandchildren all watching the brilliant sunset one more time, are forever encased in cement. The sun will continue to rise and set along the shores of Lake Huron bringing young and old, but the inconspicuous boardwalk which lays silent, was the dream and pride of a group of locals and tourists, whose community pride 112 years later, is the pride still held by locals who remember what a little community pride can achieve.",No,1.10000002384186,Within 10 metres,2022/05/18 11:22:19+00,2022/05/18 22:39:25+00,84881,0

The trail ascends and descends over cliffs and rocky outcrops and crosses beaches of boulders and driftwood. Use extreme caution when hiking this difficult terrain. The rocks can be very slippery, especially when wet with dew, fog or rain. Windblown trees may obstruct the trail. Blue, diamond-shaped symbols mark where the trail enters forested areas. Rock cairns mark exposed sections. Generally the trail hugs the coastline. If you lose the trail, continue along the shore and eventually you will find the trail again. Gargantua is the main access point for the Coastal Trail. The 14 km (8.7 mi) gravel road from Highway 17 to the parking lot at Lake Superior is rough so allow 45 minutes. South of Gargantua, the Coastal Trail is extremely rugged and very demanding. Between Gargantua and Rhyolite Cove the trail climbs over 80 metres (260 ft.) to spectacular vistas over the lake. The park’s geology is most dramatic on the coast where waves have exposed the rock shoreline. Rhyolite and Beatty coves are particularly interesting. Along the way, sand and cobble beaches are nestled in coves, providing shelter for campsites. All backcountry campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Campsites along the coast are shared by hikers and paddlers.",Yes,65,Within 10 metres,2022/05/18 11:15:53+00,2022/05/18 22:39:25+00,97505,0

The name originally came from a prominent Montreal businessman, George Pascal Desbarats, who obtained a mining license for the Portlock location in 1847. Historical notes: Over 100 years ago the Nip and Tuck Railway transported copper-bearing ore from a mine at the NW end of Rock Lake to Bruce Mines. The train ran on a now-abandoned railroad bed, which cuts diagonally across the field on the SW side of the right-angle turn on Centre Line Rd.  Fire destroyed the mine buildings at Rock Lake in 1910, terminating the transportation of copper ore. However, as late as 1924, rock was carried to the Bruce Mines harbour for landfill and breakwater construction.  In addition, the railway continued to serve the forestry and agriculture industries until the last locomotive literally burnt itself out on its own tracks near Bruce Mines.  Some of the bed is still visible, and is shown on the maps. In the late 1930's, the annual log drives on the Thessalon River system required dams, for example at the Rock Lake and Ottertail Lake outlets.  Lumber camps were also set up. One of these, a tent camp, was located at the mouth of the Thessalon River where it empties into Ottertail Lake.  Today it is a commercial camping area. The Desbarats Section of the Voyageur Trail is accessible at several points, but the only supply point is several km S of the eastern entrance.

The trail winds its way over hills and through valleys, among woodlands dominated with eastern white cedar, sugar maple and white ash.

A large tub used by a blacksmith to cool forged hot metal stood in the town centre. The area is most noted for its brownstone, quarried and used to construct Ontario's legislative buildings at Queen's Park. A side trail visits the original site of the Crowsnest Quarry. From the parking lot head towards the West Credit River. You'll pass a grist stone from a former mill, before entering a picnic area with a large fountain. From there, the Trimble Trail leads along the West Credit River. It follows the original Belfountain line, a road used by locals driving horse and buggy to reach the Forks of the Credit. Later the trail leaves this heritage road and continues on one of the old tramway lines used to transport quarried rock to the Credit Valley Railway. Belfountain Conservation Area was originally owned by Charles W. Mack, a philanthropist who invented the cushion back rubber stamp. This area was his summer retreat and stone stairs still lead up to where his house once stood. On his property, Charles built lookouts and displays: the dam he felt was a miniature Niagara Falls and the caves were a reminder of Yellowstone National Park. A stone pathway leads to these sites. With file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails.

Borer's Falls Conservation Area features informal trails and a wide variety of plants and animals, including large stands of lilacs. The Borer's Creek bridge offers a stunning view of the gorge. Borer's Falls is a classical, 17.7-metre waterfall, also known as Rock Chapel Falls. The waterfalls once powered the Rock Chapel village sawmill, run by the Borer family for more than 100 years. Land clearing in the area eventually altered the creek's flow to such a extent that it could no longer provide sufficient energy, so the family switched to steam to power the mill. This conservation area contains forested land and informal trails.

Fossils of the plants and animals that lived in the Paleozoic sea can be seen in the exposed limestone of the Onondaga Formation, in the quarry walls and on rock tableland.

Purchased by the NPCA in 1978, today the quarries and clay pits have naturalized and are home for fish, birds, waterfowl, turtles, snakes and plants. Unique alvar communities of rock-loving plants also thrive in the shallow soils.

This Conservation Area is a natural area and helps fulfill the NPCA’s objective to further the conservation, restoration, development and management of natural resources, as it is managed to provide habitat for fish and wildlife and to preserve the geological significance of the site, while providing passive recreational and educational opportunities.

The site contains the best exposed fossil and viewing area of geological formation and fossils (ancient marine lifeforms) in the Niagara Peninsula, highlighting species that lived 380- 450 million years ago in the shallow warm saltwater sea of the Michigan Basin that covered the site. Tilobites, crinoids shellfish and corrals can be seen.

This important property is home to a variety of unique and significant habitats including: alvars, prairie, cliffs, provincially significant wetlands, upland forest, low shrub areas and open water and streams. It contains terrestrial and aquatic habitat, supporting waterfowl staging areas, and is home to a number of birds (passerine, raptors waterfowl), mammals, fish, turtles, snakes, frogs, toads, and salamanders. 

This wetland is unique as it attracts a large variety of bird species, with over 50 different confirmed sightings.

The Lynde Shores Conservation Area provides excellent habitat for nesting birds and acts as an important stopover point for waterfowl and shorebirds migrating along the north shore of Lake Ontario. In addition to their importance to wildlife, both Lynde Creek Marsh and Cranberry Marsh provide many other important functions that are typical of the few remaining coastal wetlands found along this northern section of the Lake Ontario shoreline. As a result, these two marshes are designated as provincially significant wetlands and are part of a long-term study, the Durham Region Coastal Wetland Monitoring Project. To help you get a closer look at this important area, Lynde Shores Conservation Area has a number of looping trails (5 km including the 1 km looping trail within the Cranberry West Tract). These trails are just the right length for little ones and are generally stroller and wheelchair friendly.

Through the hard work of community members, led by the Black Creek Conservation Project, the valley has been changed from sterile, groomed parkland into a more natural state of wildness, if not exactly wilderness. Start your walk from the visitor parking lot at Black Creek Pioneer Village by heading down the delivery vehicle access road that leads into the valley from the road down to the valley and start walking south. Don¿t feel you have to stick to the paved path; there are often more interesting sights to be seen if you walk on the turf closer to the naturalized areas. The path at times draws away from the creek, so you might want to take the occasional side trail back toward the banks, being careful not to step on any of the silver maple, cedar, red oak or dogwood seedlings that have been planted amongst the tall grasses and along the stream banks. Facilities such as barbecues, picnic tables and washrooms are found at the south end of Northwood Park. From here, walkers can continue out to Sheppard Avenue and then make their way back to the starting point. Directions: You may take the Jane 35B bus, this will take you to the Black Creek Pioneer Village where this walk begins.

From Steeles to York Mills Road, the river wanders freely across its flood plain, which remains in an untended state for the entire length. This isn¿t exactly wilderness, but up near the north boundary of Metropolitan Toronto it¿s wild enough that on a quiet morning walk through here you can encounter fox and other wildlife. This walk actually begins by following German Mills Creek, a tributary of the East Don. From the overpass on Leslie just south of Steeles, follow the dirt path on the south side of the creek. The path passes along a schoolyard fence and then reaches a wider and drier section of the flood plain. There¿s not a lot of mature tree growth alon this side of the river; it¿s mostly a matter of a few Manitoba maples and some willows gathered in clusters here and there. Shortly the creek itself makes a wide S bend, just past these curves, the path crosses under a railway trestle and, after this point, the opposite side of the valley becomes quite wooded. Directions: Take the Steeles East 53 bus from Finch station to Steeles and Leslie. Walk south on Leslie to the bridge over the East Don. From the end point of the walk, take the York Mills 95 bus west to the York Mills station. There is no parking on Leslie, so if you drive, you will have to leave your car at a lot near the Finch station and take the bus or find parking on a side street near Steeles and Leslie.",Yes,13.3999996185303,Within 10 metres,2023/11/14 09:58:29+00,2023/11/14 22:40:20+00,199089,0

As the last remaining lakefront marsh between Toronto and Burlington , this environmentally sensitive wetland offers a different experience for nature lovers. Rattray Marsh is home to a variety of wildlife and plants and a definite must see for avid bird watchers, photographers and nature lovers. CVC, along with local residents and other interest groups have implemented numerous trail upgrades in order to preserve the area’s many sensitive features. Raised platforms allow for wider and higher pathways designed to keep visitors on the main trails and the natural areas undisturbed. The popular waterfront trail travels through the property but there is no cycling allowed in the conservation area. Secured by CVC in 1972, and officially opened in 1975, Rattray represents many things to its visitors. Some remember how it was saved from the developer who planned to fill it in and build homes, while others remember it as a living classroom where they came for guided tours to learn about nature. Plant life is abundant and beautiful at the marsh. Rattray is home to a large variety of wildflowers, which include Ontario ‘s large-flowered trillium, jack-in-the-pulpit and the red-berried nightshade. There is also numerous tree species including oak, birch, willow, hemlock, ash and maple. Although bird life at the marsh constantly changes throughout the seasons, bird watchers relish in sighting the ever-present wood warbler, eastern kingbirds, tree swallows, grey catbirds, and spotted sandpipers. Wading birds delight in the marsh and creek habitat of Rattray. Look for black-crowned night herons, green-backed herons and great blue herons during your visit.

At first you look deeply into the ravines, from one ridge to another. It begins in the forest and leads toward the falls. Halfway through, as you start to follow the creek, the landscape changes. The even ground becomes rugged with boulders jutting into the hills. The stairs on steep parts help you ascend toSmokey Hollow. It's difficult to imagine that this quiet valley was a bustling industrial centre. Many chimneys dispatched smoke and steam and the valley earned the name Smokey Hollow. By early 1900s, as steam and electricity replaced water power, mill operators had to contend with declining markets and more efficient energy sources. Fire claimed several of the mills and the final blow came in 1912 when a railway was constructed through the valley. A placard at the waterfall lookout displays a picture of railway construction in 1912, and, the industry that was around it. More spectacular than the scene at this overlook is the hidden waterfall that cascades down a distant hillside along the trail. Don't miss it! Highlight: Smokey Hollow Gorge, deep ravines. With file information from the Bruce Trail, for more information on this and other Bruce trails please purchase the Bruce Trail map and trail guidebook. The Bruce Trail is the oldest and longest marked hiking trail in Canada. It is 840 km long, with over 440 km of side trails. Every year more than 400,000 visits are made to the Trail as people walk, snowshoe, watch wildlife, take photographs and admire the glorious scenery of the Escarpment.

These areas provide habitat for trilliums, white-tailed deer, shagbark hickory and much more. Patches of forests and natural corridors provide opportunities for plants and animal to move and colonize. The areas adjacent to the stream, called corridors, act as buffers to reduce erosion, cool the water and help prevent sediment and chemical run-off such as road salt and herbicides from entering into the creek.  The natural areas help minimize the impacts of flooding and erosion patterns, caused by urban development. Sawmill Creek travels over rich historical roots and heritage landmarks, such as the Adamson Homestead, Glen Erin Inn, The Grange, Lislehurst, St. Peter’s Anglican Church and the former Erindale Public School.  Many of the early families who settled this area are commemorated by street names. The name of the creek itself provides a valuable link to our past, referencing a vital pioneer industry once located along its banks.

At Pioneer Park, walkers are directed to descend the stairs to one of the area's many beautiful beaches. After a short beachcombing walk, the most beautiful boat harbour on the Great Lakes gradually reveals itself. The colourful sailboats and the sturdy commercial fishing boats present a scene that artists and photographers have captured for decades. This is the largest recreational boat harbour on the eastern shore of Lake Huron.

It is characterized by boardwalks, steps, ladders, and bridges, all made from materials at hand.  These may be poorly maintained, so caution is advised when encountering structures. The trail begins at Angler Creek in Sturdee Cove.  Just a short wade across the creek (N) leads to a secluded sand beach, ideal for camping. The 24 km portion of the trail south of Marathon (8.0 to 31.6) was officially opened 2000; the project was completed by a group of volunteers led by Glenn Labrash and Rob Woito.  This is a solid two-day hike leading to the Pic River, and from there connecting by road to the Pukaskwa Coastal Trail at Hattie Cove. South of Heron Bay the Trail is much more rugged than that north of there.  Evidence of the logging history may be seen in the log boom relics along the shoreline sections.  Lookouts are well worth the struggle to attain them.  Sand dunes near the Pic River are perhaps the most impressive along Superior's north shore.

The name Etobicoke means, “Where the Black Alders Grows”.  The Etobicoke Creek played its part in Brampton’s development, but because it was slow and meandering, it could never sustain large-scale milling operations.  The Brampton settlement grew more slowly as a result.  Due to its meandering form, buildings along Main Street North were constructed on unique angles to allow for the natural flow of the Etobicoke Creek.  The creek once flowed through the downtown core, and its banks overflowed repeatedly through the first 150 years of Brampton’s history.  Completed in 1952, the ambitious engineering project to diver Etobicoke Creek away from the downtown allowed Brampton to prosper. The multi-use Etobicoke Creek Trail is suitable or walking, jogging, and cycling year-round.  There are many wonderful spots on this trail to stop and enjoy the sounds of nature’s wonders.  From the Peel Village Golf Course the trail passes under Steeles Avenue.  As the Etobicoke Creek Trail meanders through the downtown, a wide variety of cultural and seasonal activities can be accessed by the trail.  A farmer’s market is held every Saturday morning during spring, summer, and fall in the Rose Theatre Square.  The nearby Gage Park is voted to be one of the top five parks within the Greater Toronto Area.

This significant natural area contains two beautiful waterfalls: Webster's and Tews Falls. Webster's is a magnificent tiered waterfall and Tews, which towers at 41 metres, is only a few metres shorter than Niagara Falls. Both offer spectacular vistas of the gorge. A nature trail allows access to the Dundas Peak, which provides stunning views of Dundas and Hamilton. Other pathways passing through the park include the Bruce Trail, and a side-trail to historic Crook's Hollow Conservation Area. Before you visit, please note: The staircase at Webster's Falls is now closed to the public. NO Barbecues, fires or sound equipment are not allowed at this conservation area. As Webster's Falls and the Spencer Gorge become more popular, increasing pressure is being put on the parking areas and surrounding community. At times, the parking lot at Webster's Falls is completely full. 'Parking Lot Full' signs will be put up on roads leading to Webster's Falls as the parking area fills. Alternate parking areas located less than a half kilometer walk from Webster's Falls can be found at Tew's Falls along Harvest Road and the Greensville Optimist Park at the intersection of Highway #8 and Brock Road in Greensville. On beautiful sunny weekends, please watch for these 'Parking Lot Full' signs when heading out to Webster's Falls to avoid long delays on the narrow roadways approaching the main parking lot on Fallsview Road.

These are caused by climatic variations that can occur in a small area.In the canyon’s rock crevices there may still be snow and ice in July. Some of the plants are rare and very sensitive.

His love of the outdoors led him to investigate the nature of wetlands and the special needs of the orchids.  Wetlands are important to the ecosystem.  They maintain and improve water quality, protect shorelines from erosion, aid in flood control, provide fish and wildlife habitat and benefit our economy and society through resource products and outdoor recreation.  This wetland contains a marsh and a swamp in the area near the beaver pond and a fen where the orchids grow.  While working in the fen, Mr. Purdon learned about orchid cultivation and he began to apply beneficial management practices, including thinning the brush to create new areas for orchid development, maintaining appropriate water levels and hand pollinating the plant.  For the next fifty years, Mr. Purdon became the steward of this wetland.  The orchids multiplied and thrived.  As he neared the end of his life, Mr. Purdon wanted to ensure that the wetlands would be enjoyed and appreciated by future generations.

This natural terrain path can be accessed from the Pelham Road entrance.  The trail begins about .5 kilometers or 15 minutes from the parking lot along the northeast section of the Black Walnut Trail. The trail extends to the eastern park boundary; from this point the hiker must retrace his footsteps for a total round trip of approximately 2.6 kilometers which takes about 1 hour.  While part of the trail is easy, several hills can make this a moderate to difficult hike. The first part of the trail follows the remains of an old farmer's road, known as the Hog's Back. In earlier times, it was probably used to haul materials through the valley to and from the mills at Power Glen and to avoid the steep hill on today's First Street Louth.  The main feature of the trail is the meandering Twelve Mile Creek, Niagara's only cold-water creek, historically noted for its quality trout fishing. The river bank and flood plain also provide a home to birds and various small mammals. Natural vegetation include a mix of Basswood, Beech, Maple, Oak and Ironwood in the upland areas and large Bitternut Hickory and Black Walnut trees in the valley. Stands of  White Pine and Spruce open into grassland.

It was acquired by J.W. Trousdale, a prominent citizen of Sydenham, in 1901, and was mined steadily until 1912. At this time it was abandoned because water had seeped in from the lake. The main shaft was over 100 feet deep, and opened out to a chamber 8 feet by 30 feet. On the property were a boarding house, trimming-shed, stable, forge, and other buildings. No power machinery was used, and hoisting from the pits was done by a horse-derrick and whims. From 1967 to 1973, the CRCA acquired the lands that now make up Gould Lake Conservation Area.

In the 1930s, Mr. Purdon discovered a clump of about a dozen Showy Lady’s Slipper Orchids growing in the wetland on his farm.  His love of the outdoors led him to investigate the nature of wetlands and the special needs of the orchids.  Wetlands are important to the ecosystem.  They maintain and improve water quality, protect shorelines from erosion, aid in flood control, provide fish and wildlife habitat and benefit our economy and society through resource products and outdoor recreation.  This wetland contains a marsh and a swamp in the area near the beaver pond and a fen where the orchids grow.  While working in the fen, Mr. Purdon learned about orchid cultivation and he began to apply beneficial management practices, including thinning the brush to create new areas for orchid development, maintaining appropriate water levels and hand pollinating the plant.  For the next fifty years, Mr. Purdon became the steward of this wetland.  The orchids multiplied and thrived.  As he neared the end of his life, Mr. Purdon wanted to ensure that the wetlands would be enjoyed and appreciated by future generations.  Mississippi Valley Conservation acquired the site in 1984. To protect the fen and yet bring the beauty of the orchids within easy access of the visitor, a wooden boardwalk was constructed through the heart of the colony.  The trail from the upper parking lot leads to a scenic lookout over a beaver pond, a picnic area with a pit toilet and a set of stairs that leads down to the boardwalk.  The lower parking lot, picnic area and pit toilet are wheelchair accessible.  The platform attached to the boardwalk contains a gift stand which is open during the orchid blooming period, and a series of “orchid trees” that highlight the names of people who support Purdon Conservation Area by “adopting” an orchid.",No,0.400000005960464,Within 10 metres,2023/12/07 08:54:23+00,2023/12/07 22:25:20+00,259889,0

The Lynde Shores Conservation Area provides excellent habitat for nesting birds and acts as an important stopover point for waterfowl and shorebirds migrating along the north shore of Lake Ontario. In addition to their importance to wildlife, both Lynde Creek Marsh and Cranberry Marsh provide many other important functions that are typical of the few remaining coastal wetlands found along this northern section of the Lake Ontario shoreline. As a result, these two marshes are designated as provincially significant wetlands and are part of a long-term study, the Durham Region Coastal Wetland Monitoring Project. To help you get a closer look at this important area, Lynde Shores Conservation Area has a number of looping trails (5 km including the 1 km looping trail within the Cranberry West Tract). These trails are just the right length for little ones and are generally stroller and wheelchair friendly.
